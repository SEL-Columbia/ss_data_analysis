Various scripts used to load data into timeseries databases and 
analyze that data.

Be extremely careful running these scripts on "production" as
they will overwrite existing data dumps without modifying hard-coded
configuration variables.  This needs a bit of TLC before being 
generally useful.  

Load scripts:
base.py, final.py (sample run in conversion.txt)

The rest of the scripts perform varied analyses on that data (to
be elaborated).
